# Engraftment Index
Calculating relative and absolute engraftment index for post FMT samples requires:
1) donor-recipient pairing
2) PCo1 and PCo2 values generated from beta-diversity analysis using principal coordinate analysis on a abundance-weighted Jaccard distance profile (QIIME v1.9)

Examples of input and output files are included in this repo.
